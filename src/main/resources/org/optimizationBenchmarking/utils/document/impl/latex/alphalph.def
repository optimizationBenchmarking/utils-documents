% We use the alphalph package to deal with situations where counters become
% larger than 26 but should be presented as letters. This might be the case
% in some document classes which use alphabetic section "numbers" when a
% document is automatically generated and we do not have much control about
% the actual number of sections. The limit of 26 could also be hit in
% enumerations with many elements. We thus simply replace \alph and \Alph
% with \alphalph and \AlphAlph, respectively, which can count higher.
