% The textcomp package [1, 2] provides a command called \capitaldotaccent
% but no corresponding command for lower case letters. Normally, the right
% way to get a "c" with a dot above would be writing {\.{c}}. However,
% some BibTeX styles [3] eat all dots, so we would get {\{c}}, which
% explodes. Thus we define the command below.
